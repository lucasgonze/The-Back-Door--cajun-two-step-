Lilypond transcription of a traditional cajun tune. Based on the accordion part in the D. L. Menard recording. Melody and chords only, no lyrics. My source was http://rd.io/x/QFoqKzLxzw . 

I refactored my standard Makefile and directory structure from previous repos of mine on Github, so that you shouldn't have to modify any files below src. Also fixed a bug in my standard Bb.ly file.
